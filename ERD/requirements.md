## ðŸ–¼ ER Diagram
The ER Diagram was created using [Draw.io](https://draw.io) and saved as both PNG and editable XML format. It includes:

## âœ… Notes
- All relationships were carefully defined using cardinality (1:1, 1:N).
- Foreign keys were identified to enforce referential integrity.
- The model is designed to scale and reflect realistic Airbnb-like interactions.
